This website presents the results of the Monte Alb\u00e1n Geophysical Archaeology Project (MAGAP), an intensive study of the site\u2019s Main Plaza.

The site covers a series of hilltops lying within the broad Valley of Oaxaca. The Main Plaza was the civic-ceremonial heart of Monte Alb\u00e1n, consisting of a large rectangular space that was surrounded by monumental structures. Our project is utilizing geophysical prospection and digital mapping techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the Main Plaza. We want to examine the function, role, and meaning of the Main Plaza and how this may have changed over the course of the site\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>Monte Alb\u00e1n remained an important capital for over a thousand years, and its political collapse around AD 850 remains poorly understood. Studies of hieroglyphic writing from carved stone monuments at the site indicate that this was a Zapotec capital. Numbering in the hundreds of thousands today, Zapotec-speakers are the largest of more than a dozen indigenous groups from Oaxaca.
